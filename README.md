# Nuxt 3 + Vuetify 3 Starter

I've created a starter kit for Nuxt 3 and Vuetify along with eslint setup. Be sure to have EsLint and Prettier extension installed in your VSCode for it to automatically format following the set of rules.

- For further Nuxt 3 documentation, please look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
- I referred to `Program with Erik`'s youtube video to set this up. Here's a link to his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB7c0G3kVuw&t=560s).

## What I used
- `Nuxt 3`
- `Vuetify 3`

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
